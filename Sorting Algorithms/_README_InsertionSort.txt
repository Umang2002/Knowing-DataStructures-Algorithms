*********************INSERTION SORT*********************

1]It is simple and efficient.
2]In this algorithm, each iteration removes
an element from the input data and inserts it into the correct position in the list being sorted. 
3]Advantages
• Simple implementation
• Efficient for small data.
• Adaptive: If the input list is presorted [may not be completely] then insertions sort
takes O(n + d), where d is the number of inversions
• Practically more efficient than selection and bubble sorts, even though all of them
have O(n2) worst case complexity.
