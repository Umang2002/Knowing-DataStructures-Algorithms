*********************SELECTION SORT*********************

1]Selection sort works well for small data.
2]It is an in-place sorting algorithm.
3]Easy to implement.

4]Algorithm: 
i. Find the minimum value in the list.
ii. Swap it with the value in the current position.
iii. Repeat this process for all the elements until the entire array is sorted.

5]This algorithm is called selection sort since it repeatedly selects the smallest element.
6]It is used for sorting the files with very large values and small keys. This is because selection is made
based on keys and swaps are made only when required.

7]Performance:
Worst case complexity : O(n2)
Best case complexity : O(n2)
Average case complexity : O(n2)
Worst case space complexity: O(1) auxiliary
