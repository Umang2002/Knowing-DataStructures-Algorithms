*********************MERGE SORT*********************

1]It is an example of "Divide and Conquer" strategy.
2]Merging is the process of combining two sorted files to make one bigger sorted file.
3]Selection and merging are opposite operations:
○ Selection splits a list into two lists.
○ Merging joins two files to make one file.

4]Merge sort is Quick sort's complement.
  To know about Quick Sort: Check here :--

5]Merge sort divides the list into two parts then each part is Conquered Individually.
6]Merge sort is stable.

7]In merge sort input list is divided into 2 parts and solved recursively.
